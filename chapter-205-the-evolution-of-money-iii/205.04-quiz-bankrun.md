# 205.04 Quiz - bankRun

**Question:** What is a potential outcome of banks issuing more paper notes than they held deposits?

**Correct Answer:** A sudden drain of deposits en masse, leading to systemic fears and drying up of liquidity\
**Positive Remark:** You got it right! When banks issue more paper notes than they have deposits to back them up, it can lead to a sudden rush of depositors trying to withdraw their money all at once. This can expose the bank's excessive leverage through fractional reserve banking and bring the financial system to a stop. Interesting stuff!

**Wrong Answer:** A nice vacation for everyone\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, taking a vacation isn't quite the outcome we're looking for here. Better luck next time!

**Wrong Answer:** A sudden increase in the price of gasoline\
**Negative Remark:** Gas prices might fluctuate for a variety of reasons, but this particular scenario doesn't have much to do with it. Try again!
