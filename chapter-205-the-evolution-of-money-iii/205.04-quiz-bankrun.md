# 205.04 Quiz - bankRun

**Question:** What is one potential outcome of banks and vaults issuing IOUs in excess of their deposits?

**Correct Answer:** A sudden drain of deposits en masse, leading to systemic fears and drying up of liquidity\
**Positive Remark:** You got it right! When banks and vaults issue more IOUs than they have deposits to back them up, it can lead to a sudden rush of depositors trying to withdraw their money all at once. This can expose the institution's excessive leverage through fractional reserve banking, leading to systemic fears and drying up of liquidity throughout the financial system. Interesting stuff!

**Wrong Answer:** A nice vacation for everyone\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, taking a vacation isn't quite the outcome we're looking for here. Better luck next time!

**Wrong Answer:** A sudden increase in the price of gasoline\
**Negative Remark:** Gas prices might fluctuate for a variety of reasons, but this particular scenario doesn't have much to do with it. Try again!
