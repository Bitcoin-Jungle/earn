**Question:** What was the main problem with the gold standard system for governments and citizens?

**Negative Remark:** I'm sorry, but the gold standard did not make it hard for people to save money in the bank. It was actually a problem for citizens because it did not provide any guarantee that their deposits in the bank would be safe, as the value of their money was dependent on the government's ability to maintain its gold reserves.
