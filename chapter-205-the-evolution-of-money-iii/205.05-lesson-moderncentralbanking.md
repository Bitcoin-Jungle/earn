**Text:** Sometimes, people may try to take all their money out of the bank at the same time, called a "bank run." This can happen because banks only keep a small amount of money on hand, and the rest is used for loans.&#x20;

Governments saw this as a problem, so they decided to create their own banks called "central banks." These banks have the special power to make their own money, initially backed by gold. They also act as a backup plan for when other banks need extra money to stay open.&#x20;

Central banks are the "lenders of last resort," meaning they can create and give out money when commercial banks need liquidity to service withdrawals.
