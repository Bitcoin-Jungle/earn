**Text:** To counter the problem of bank runs, governments created their own banks called "central banks."&#x20;

These central banks have the special power to create money. They act as a backup plan for when commercial banks run out of reserves and need extra money to stay open.&#x20;

Because of this function, central banks are also called the "lenders of last resort," meaning they can create and give out money when commercial banks need liquidity to service withdrawals.
