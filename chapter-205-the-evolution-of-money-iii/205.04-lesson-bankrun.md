**Text:** Banks sometimes issued more paper notes than they had deposits, which could cause problems in the economy. If people started to doubt the solvency of a bank, they might rush to withdraw their money all at once before others do. This is called a bank run.

The sudden loss of deposits from the bank run could reveal that the bank was using too much leverage through Fractional Reserve Banking. This could cause a lack of liquidity and bring the whole financial system to a stop.
