**Text:** The earliest human societies engaged in trade through barter, but this method had several limitations. One issue was the "double coincidence of wants" problem, where two people needed to desire the same item at the same time in order to complete a trade.

To overcome this issue, humans began to collect and value certain items for their rarity and symbolic significance, such as shells, animal teeth, and flint.

These collectibles served as a way for early humans to store and transfer wealth, providing an evolutionary advantage over other species such as Homo neanderthalensis.
