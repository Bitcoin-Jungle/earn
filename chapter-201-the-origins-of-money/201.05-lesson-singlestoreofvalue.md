**Text:** As human societies and trade routes developed over time, stores of value that emerged in different societies began to compete with each other. Merchants and traders had to decide whether to save their profits in the store of value of their own society or in the store of value of the society they were trading with, or a combination of both.

Holding savings in a foreign store of value gave merchants the ability to complete trade more easily in that society, and also gave them an incentive to promote the adoption of that store of value in their own society, as it would increase the purchasing power of their savings.

When two societies adopt the same store of value, they see a significant reduction in the cost of trading with each other and an increase in trade-based wealth. In the 19th century, most of the world converged on a single store of value – gold – and this period saw the greatest increase in trade in history.
