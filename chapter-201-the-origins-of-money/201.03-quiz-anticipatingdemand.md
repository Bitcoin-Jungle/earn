# 201.03 Quiz - anticipatingDemand

**Question:** What was the main advantage of being able to anticipate future demand for collectible items in early human societies?

**Correct Answer:** The ability to buy collectibles at a lower price before they became widely sought after\
**Positive Remark:** Congratulations, you are correct! It seems that the concept of "buy low, sell high" is not a modern invention, as early humans also sought to acquire collectibles at a lower cost before their demand and trade value increased. Fun fact: this principle also applies to bitcoin, where early adopters were able to acquire bitcoins at a much lower price before their value skyrocketed.

**Wrong Answer:** The ability to trade collectibles for other useful items\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, that is not the correct answer. While being able to trade collectibles for other useful items may have been a benefit of correctly anticipating demand, it was not the main advantage.

**Wrong Answer:** The ability to impress others with their collection of rare and valuable items\
**Negative Remark:** I'm afraid that is not the correct answer. While having a collection of rare and valuable items may have been a source of pride and admiration, it was not the main advantage
