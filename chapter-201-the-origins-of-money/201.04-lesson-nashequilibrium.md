**Text:** Acquiring an item with the expectation that it will be desired as a future store of value can accelerate its adoption for that purpose. This process can create a feedback loop that drives societies towards adopting a single store of value.

In game theory, this is known as a "Nash Equilibrium". Reaching a Nash Equilibrium for a store of value can greatly benefit a society, as it makes trade and the division of labor easier and paves the way for the development of civilization.
