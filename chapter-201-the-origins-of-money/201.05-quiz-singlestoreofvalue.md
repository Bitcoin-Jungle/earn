# 201.05 Quiz - singleStoreOfValue

**Question:** Why did merchants and traders in early human societies have an incentive to promote the adoption of a foreign store of value in their own society?

**Correct Answer:** To increase the purchasing power of their savings\
**Positive Remark:** Correct! Merchants and traders had an incentive to promote the adoption of a foreign store of value in their own society because it increased the purchasing power of their savings. This not only benefited the merchants, but also the society as a whole, as the adoption of a single store of value reduced the cost of completing trade with other societies and increased trade-based wealth. Fun fact: Bitcoin is an example of a store of value that has been adopted by many societies, and its widespread adoption has increased its purchasing power and facilitated trade.

**Wrong Answer:** To learn about other cultures and societies\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, that is not the correct answer. While learning about other cultures and societies may have been a side benefit of promoting the adoption of a foreign store of value, it was not the main reason.

**Wrong Answer:** To show off their wealth and status\
**Negative Remark:** I'm afraid that is not the correct answer. While showing off wealth and status may have been a motivation for some individuals, it was not the main reason for why merchants and traders had an incentive to promote the adoption of a foreign store of value in their own society.
