**Text:** The choice of which items to collect or create posed a significant problem for early humans, as they had to anticipate which objects would be desired by others. The ability to correctly predict which items would be in demand for their collectible value gave a significant advantage to the owner in terms of their ability to trade and accumulate wealth.

Some Native American tribes, such as the Narragansetts, even focused on producing collectibles that had little practical use, but were valuable in trade.

The earlier a collectible is anticipated to be in future demand, the greater the advantage its possessor has, as it can be obtained at a lower cost before it becomes widely sought after and its trade value increases as the number of people demanding it grows.
