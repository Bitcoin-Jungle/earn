**Text:** Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital versions of traditional currency that are issued and backed by a central bank.&#x20;

CBDCs are not decentralized or permissionless like Bitcoin, and are instead intended to compete with other forms of digital payment methods for market dominance.&#x20;

One of the main reasons for the development of CBDCs is the surveillance and censorship capabilities they provide the issuer.&#x20;

Additionally, in an age of negative real interest rates (when the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate), the widespread adoption of CBDCs often goes hand in hand with the phasing out of physical cash, which can lead to the devaluation of the currency in real terms.
