**Question:** Which problem did Satoshi have to solve to create Bitcoin?

**Correct Answer:** The double spending problem\
**Positive Remark:**  Good job. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism where transactions are batched into blocks and chained together to a blockchain. This way, every user knows that every coin is only spent once.

**Wrong Answer:** The problem of double coincidence of wants\
**Negative Remark:** Not quite. The double coincidence of wants is a problem of barter that can be solved with money. Try again!

**Wrong Answer:** The halving problem\
**Negative Remark:** Hah no. The halving in bitcoin is not a problem, but part of the solution that Satoshi designed! More on that in Chapter 302. Try again!
