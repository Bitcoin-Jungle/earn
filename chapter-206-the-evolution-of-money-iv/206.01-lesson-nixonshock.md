**Text:** The Bretton Woods system was a monetary system established after World War II in order to address global economic instability and high levels of debt.&#x20;

Under this system, many countries pegged their own currencies to the value of the US dollar, which was itself pegged to the value of gold at a fixed exchange rate. This meant that the value of other countries' currencies was indirectly tied to the value of gold through the US dollar.&#x20;

In 1971, President Nixon directed the US Treasury Secretary to stop allowing foreign governments to exchange their dollars for gold, a process known as "convertibility." This effectively ended the Bretton Woods system and marked the beginning of a new monetary system based on floating exchange rates.
