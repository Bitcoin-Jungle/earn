# 206.08 Quiz - CBDCs

**Question:** What is the main purpose of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)?

**Correct Answer:** To provide surveillance and censorship capabilities to the issuer\
**Positive Remark:** That's correct! CBDCs are like the Big Brother of digital currencies, designed to provide surveillance and censorship capabilities to the issuer. Creepy, but correct!

**Wrong Answer:** To compete with Bitcoin as a store of value\
**Negative Remark:** Haha, sorry but no. While Bitcoin and CBDCs are both digital currencies, they have very different purposes and characteristics. CBDCs are issued and backed by central banks, while Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any government or financial institution.

**Wrong Answer:** To create a decentralized and permissionless digital currency\
**Negative Remark:** Oh boy, that's a creative answer but unfortunately not quite right. CBDCs are not designed to be decentralized or permissionless like Bitcoin. In fact, they are issued and backed by central banks, and their main purpose is to be the ultimate tool for control in the digital age. Better luck next time!
