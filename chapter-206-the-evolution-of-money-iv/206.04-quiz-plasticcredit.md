**Question:** What is a credit card?

**Correct Answer:** A type of payment card that allows people to borrow money to pay for things\

**Wrong Answer:** A card that grants the holder special powers, like the ability to fly\
**Negative Remark:** Not quite, but a credit card that grants special powers like the ability to fly sounds like it could be a lot of fun!

**Wrong Answer:** A card that allows people to pay for things by waving their hand over a sensor\
**Negative Remark:** Nope, but a credit card that allows people to pay for things by waving their hand over a sensor sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, not real life.
