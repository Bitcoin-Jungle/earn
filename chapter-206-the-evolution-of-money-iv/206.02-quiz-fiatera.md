**Question:** What does the word "fiat" mean when it is used to talk about money?

**Correct Answer:** A currency issued by a government that is not directly exchangeable for a fixed amount of something else\

Fiat money, such as Federal Reserve notes, is a type of currency issued by a government that is not directly exchangeable for a fixed amount of something else, like gold or silver. Its value comes from the fact that the government says it is valuable and people trust that they will be able to use it to buy things.
