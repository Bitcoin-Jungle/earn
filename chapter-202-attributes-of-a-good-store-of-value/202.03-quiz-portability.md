# 202.03 Quiz - portability

**Question:** Which of the following is NOT a factor that makes a good store of value portable?

**Correct Answer:** Its physical form\
**Positive Remark:** You got it right. The physical form of the good is not a factor that makes it portable. In fact, digital currencies like bitcoin are the most portable stores of value because they can be easily stored on a small device and transmitted quickly across long distances. Did you know that private keys representing hundreds of millions of dollars can be stored on a tiny USB drive and easily carried anywhere with bitcoin? That's pretty impressive!

**Wrong Answer:** Its ability to be easily transported and stored\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, that's incorrect! The ability to be easily transported and stored is actually an important factor that makes a good store of value portable. But don't worry, it's a common mistake. After all, who wouldn't want to carry around a cow as a store of value? It would make for a pretty impressive conversation starter at least.

**Wrong Answer:** Its ability to facilitate long-distance trade\
**Negative Remark:** Oops, that's not the right answer! The ability to facilitate long-distance trade is actually an important factor that makes a good store of value portable. But hey, at least you're not alone in this mistake. It's easy to see how someone might think that cows are the perfect portable store of value, given their ability to produce milk and beef.
