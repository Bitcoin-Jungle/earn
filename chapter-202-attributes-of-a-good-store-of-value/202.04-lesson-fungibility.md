"Fungibility" means that one unit of a currency is interchangeable with another unit of the same currency. This is an important attribute for a good store of value.

Gold is a highly fungible store of value, as when melted down, an ounce of gold is essentially indistinguishable from any other. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, may not always be completely fungible, as their issuing institutions may treat different denominations differently.

Like gold, units of bitcoin are fungible, but there are some nuances to it. We'll dive into this in a later chapter.
