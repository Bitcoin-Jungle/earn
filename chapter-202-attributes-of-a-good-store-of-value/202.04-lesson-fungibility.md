**Text:** Fungibility is an important attribute for a good store of value, as it allows one specimen of the good to be interchangeable with another of equal quantity.&#x20;

Gold is a highly fungible store of value, as when melted down, an ounce of gold is essentially indistinguishable from any other. Fiat currencies, on the other hand, may not always be completely fungible, as their issuing institutions may treat different denominations differently.&#x20;

Bitcoins are fungible at the network level, but their traceability on the blockchain means that they may become tainted by their use in illicit trade and be rejected by merchants or exchanges.&#x20;

In order to be as fungible as gold, improvements to the privacy and anonymity of the Bitcoin network protocol are necessary.
