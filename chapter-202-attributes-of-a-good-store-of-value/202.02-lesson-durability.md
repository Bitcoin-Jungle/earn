**Text:** The good used as money should not be perishable or easily destroyed. Gold is known for its durability and is often considered the "king" in this regard.&#x20;

A large portion of the gold that has ever been mined or minted, including the gold of the Pharaohs, still exists today and is likely to remain available for many more years. Gold coins that were used as money in ancient times still hold significant value today.&#x20;

Fiat currencies and bitcoins are digital records that may take physical form, such as paper bills. However, it is not the physical manifestation of these currencies that should be considered for their durability, but rather the durability of the institution that issues them.&#x20;

Many governments and their currencies have come and gone over the centuries, while others, such as the US dollar and British pound, have survived for a longer period of time. Bitcoins have no issuing authority, so their durability depends on the network that secures them. While it is still early to draw strong conclusions about the durability of bitcoins, there are signs that the network has displayed a high level of "anti-fragility" despite attempts to regulate it and attacks by hackers.
