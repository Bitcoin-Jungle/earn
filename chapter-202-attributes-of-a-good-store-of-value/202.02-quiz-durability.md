# 202.02 Quiz - durability

**Question:** Which of the following is NOT an important factor in determining the durability of a good store of value?

**Correct Answer:** The network that secures the currency\
**Positive Remark:** You got it right. The network that secures the currency is an important factor in determining its durability, especially for digital currencies like bitcoin. Did you know that bitcoin has displayed a high level of "anti-fragility" despite attempts to regulate it and attacks by hackers? That's quite impressive for a currency that's still in its early stages!

**Wrong Answer:** The physical manifestation of the currency\
**Negative Remark:** Nope, sorry! The physical manifestation of the currency is actually not as important as the institution that issues it or the network that secures it. Don't worry though, you're not alone in making this mistake. Even the Ancient Greeks used to mint their coins out of perishable materials like bronze and copper!

**Wrong Answer:** The institution that issues the currency\
**Negative Remark:** Close, but not quite! The institution that issues the currency is actually an important factor in determining its durability. But hey, at least you're not alone in this mistake. There have been many governments and currencies that have come and gone over the centuries.
