**Text:** A good store of value should have a limited supply, or be scarce.&#x20;

This is because scarcity can create value, as people often desire rare or hard-to-obtain items. Bitcoin, for instance, is designed to have a maximum of 21 million units, which gives each owner a known percentage of the total possible supply.&#x20;

In contrast, the supply of gold can potentially increase through new mining methods, and fiat currencies are often prone to inflation, leading to a decline in value over time. The concept of "unforgeable costliness" proposed by Nick Szabo highlights the importance of scarcity in maintaining the value of a monetary good.
