**Question:** What are some attributes that make a good store of value?

**Correct Answer:** Durability, portability, interchangeability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, long history, and resistance to censorship\
**Positive Remark:** Yes! A good store of value should have attributes such as durability, portability, interchangeability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, a long history, and resistance to censorship. These characteristics make it easier to use as a medium of exchange and store of value, and increase its demand over time.

**Wrong Answer:** Tastiness, cuteness, softness, and Instagram-ability\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, that is not the correct answer. While tastiness, cuteness, softness, and Instagram-ability may be desirable qualities in other contexts, they are not typically considered important attributes for a store of value.

**Wrong Answer:** Rarity, beauty, and sentimental value\
**Negative Remark:** I'm afraid that is not the correct answer. While rarity, beauty, and sentimental value may make an item valuable to a particular individual, they are not typically considered important attributes for a store of value that is widely accepted and used as a medium of exchange.
