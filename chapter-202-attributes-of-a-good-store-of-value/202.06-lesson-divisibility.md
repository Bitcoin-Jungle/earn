In societies where trade is prevalent, the ability to divide a good into smaller quantities allows for more precise exchange and can make it easier to use in day-to-day transactions.&#x20;

Bitcoin is particularly useful in this regard, as it can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a unit and transmitted in tiny amounts.&#x20;

On the other hand, fiat currencies can also be easily divided, although the small denominations, such as pocket change, may not have much purchasing power. Gold, while physically divisible, can be difficult to use in small quantities for everyday trade.
