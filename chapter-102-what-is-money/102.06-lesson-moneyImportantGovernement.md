**Text:** Modern-day economies are organized by nation-states: USA, Japan, Switzerland, Brazil, Norway, China, etc.\
\
Accordingly, in most every nation, the government holds the power to issue and control money.\


In the United States, the Central Bank (known as the Federal Reserve, or “Fed”) can print, or create, more US Dollars at any time it wants.\


The “Fed” does not need permission from the President, nor Congress, and certainly not from US citizens.\


Imagine if you had the ability to print US Dollars anytime you wanted to -- what would you do??
