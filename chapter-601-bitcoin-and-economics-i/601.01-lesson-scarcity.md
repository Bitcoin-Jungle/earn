**Text:** When there are not enough resources to go around, people and organizations compete for them.&#x20;

This competition is often reflected in the price of goods and services in a free market. If the demand for a particular resource increases faster than the supply, it can become scarce and more valuable.&#x20;

Money is often used as a way to buy things because it is easy to trade and is valuable because it is scarce. Bitcoin is a digital form of money that has a fixed supply, which makes it rare and valuable.&#x20;

The idea that there is never enough of something to go around is a basic principle of economics, but it is often ignored in political decisions.
