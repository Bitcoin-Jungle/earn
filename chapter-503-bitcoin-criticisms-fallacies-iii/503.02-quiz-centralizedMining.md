**Question:** Can mining pools disrupt the bitcoin network or censor transactions?



**Correct Answer:** No, because they have a strong incentive to follow the rules of the network and maintain the integrity of the blockchain\
**Positive Remark:** Yep, that's right. Did you know that the decentralized nature of the bitcoin network ensures that no single entity, including mining pools, can disrupt the network or censor transactions?

**Wrong Answer:** Yes, because they have a majority of the hashing power\
**Negative Remark:** Nope, sorry! While mining pools do have a significant amount of hashing power, individual miners are extremely mobile and can trivially direct their hashrate to an honest mining pool.

**Wrong Answer:** Yes, but only if they are acting in their own self-interest\
**Negative Remark:** Incorrect. While it is true that mining pools have an incentive to act in their own self-interest, this does not mean that they can disrupt the bitcoin network or censor transactions.
