**Text:** Another misconception about bitcoin is that its transaction costs are prohibitively high.

However, confirmed transactions on the main layer of bitcoin provide a level of finality that is unmatched in the traditional financial system. While it is true that transaction fees may occasionally spike due to the limited capacity of each block, the bitcoin network remains an efficient and reliable settlement layer for high-value transactions.

In fact, according to Saifedean Ammous, "between October 2010 and July 2021, the average daily transaction fees came up to around 0.02% of the value of the transactions."

In addition, smaller transactions, including microtransactions, are often migrated to secondary layers such as lightning, liquid, or federated side-chains where fees are significantly lower than those offered by retail banks.
