**Text:** It is often said that a small number of wallets hold the majority of all bitcoin. While this is technically true, it is important to note that these wallets are typically owned by exchanges that have millions of customers.

Many people choose to leave their bitcoin on an exchange, but it is generally considered best practice to keep bitcoin in a personal wallet for security and privacy reasons.

It is also worth noting that a single bitcoin address can contain bitcoin belonging to multiple users, and a single user can control multiple wallets. To maintain privacy, it is recommended to generate a new address for each receiving transaction instead of reusing the same address.
