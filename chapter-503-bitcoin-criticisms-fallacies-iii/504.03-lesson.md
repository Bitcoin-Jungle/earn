**Text:** One common misconception about bitcoin is that it is too expensive to purchase.&#x20;

However, this belief is based on unit bias, as it is more accurate to compare the entire market capitalization of bitcoin to other assets rather than just the unit price of a single bitcoin.&#x20;

It's also worth noting that a single bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis. As the saying goes, "you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin!"
