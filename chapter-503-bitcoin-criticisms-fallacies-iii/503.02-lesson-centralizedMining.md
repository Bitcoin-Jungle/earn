**Text:** Some people believe that mining pools, which are groups of miners that work together to increase their chances of finding a block, could potentially disrupt the bitcoin network or censor transactions.

However, this concern stems from a lack of understanding of the incentives of miners and their role in the network. In reality, miners have a strong incentive to follow the rules of the network and maintain the integrity of the blockchain, as their own profits depend on it.

As Jimmy Song said, "A majority of hashing power can't: take coins you already possess away, change the rules of bitcoin, or hurt you without hurting themselves."
