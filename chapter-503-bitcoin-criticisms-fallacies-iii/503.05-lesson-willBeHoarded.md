**Text:** There is a common belief that the fixed supply of bitcoin incentivizes hoarding, or the act of holding onto bitcoin rather than spending it in the economy.

However, this logic has a few flaws. First, saving, or the act of setting aside income for future use, is often conflated with hoarding. In fact, saving is a necessary precursor to significant investment and can be seen as a responsible financial practice.

Second, holding onto bitcoin, or any form of money, is a common way to hedge against future uncertainty and does not necessarily mean that it is not being used.

As Pierre Rochard pointed out, "all bitcoin are always held by someone, payments only change who is holding it." In other words, the act of holding bitcoin is itself a use of bitcoin.
