# 603.01 Quiz - unitBias

**Question:** What is unit bias?

**Correct Answer:** The belief that one unit of something is always the right amount to use when comparing it to other things\
**Positive Remark:** Yep! Unit bias is the belief that one unit of something is always the right amount to use when comparing it to other things. However, this is not always true and can lead to faulty reasoning. Good job!

**Wrong Answer:** The belief that one type of currency is better than all others\
**Negative Remark:** I'm afraid you're mistaken. Unit bias is not about believing that one type of currency is better than all others. Maybe you should stick to counting your coins instead of trying to determine the value of currency!

**Wrong Answer:** The belief that all units of something should be the same size\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, but unit bias is not about the size of units. Don't worry, though â€“ you can still have fun with different sizes of units by playing with building blocks or LEGO bricks.
