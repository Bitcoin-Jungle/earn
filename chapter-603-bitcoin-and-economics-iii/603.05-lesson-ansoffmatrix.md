The people who work on bitcoin, like the people who write the code and help others understand how to use it, are trying to increase the number of people who use it and make it easier for them to do so.&#x20;

Bitcoin can be used to save money and protect it from being taken away, or it can be used to send and receive small amounts of money quickly, without having to go through a lot of steps. As more people start using bitcoin, it has the potential to grow and become more popular.&#x20;

It is also possible for people and companies to use bitcoin as part of their financial plans, to help protect their money from losing value.
