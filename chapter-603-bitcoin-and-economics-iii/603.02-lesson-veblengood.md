Some people might want to buy bitcoin because it is a status symbol, but the main reason people will probably want to buy it is because there is a limited amount of it.&#x20;

When more people want to buy bitcoin, the price goes up and it becomes easier to use. When it is easy to use, more people want to use it. This creates a cycle where the demand for bitcoin increases, the price goes up, and it becomes easier to use.
