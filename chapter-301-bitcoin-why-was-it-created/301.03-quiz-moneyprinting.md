# 301.03 Quiz - moneyPrinting

**Question:** What is one of the main consequences of excessive money printing and credit expansion?

**Correct Answer:** Asset bubbles in stock and real estate markets that experience corrections roughly every decade\
**Positive Remark:** Bullseye! Asset bubbles in stock and real estate markets are indeed one of the main consequences of excessive money printing and credit expansion. It's worth noting that these bubbles often disproportionately benefit those closest to the source of new money, while lower income individuals are often the most affected by the inflation and economic booms and busts that result.

**Wrong Answer:** A sudden increase in the popularity of polka music\
**Negative Remark:** That's not the right wavelength here! While some believe easy money has a negative impact on music, this is not the right answer.

**Wrong Answer:** A decrease in the number of people who believe in extraterrestrial life forms\
**Negative Remark:** Your guess is out of this world. While it's certainly interesting to speculate about the existence of aliens, it has nothing to do with the consequences of excessive money printing and credit expansion.
