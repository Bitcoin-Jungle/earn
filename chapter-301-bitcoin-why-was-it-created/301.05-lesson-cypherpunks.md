**Text:** Bitcoin is the result of decades of research work by a group of individuals who call themselves Cypherpunks. They are interested in using cryptography to promote privacy and security in a world where increasing surveillance in the digital age can lead to erosion of freedoms.

Earlier digital cash systems that relied on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks had one or both of the following problems:

* They required a central authority to manage the ledger of ownership.
* The currency units could be copied, resulting in the "double-spending problem" where a single unit could be spent multiple times.&#x20;

Satoshi addressed both of these issues by combining existing technologies in the creation of Bitcoin. The first issue is resolved because the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network means that there is no central authority that users need to trust. The second issue is addressed because the unique cryptographic techniques used in Bitcoin make it impossible to copy the currency units.
