**Question:** Why did Satoshi Nakamoto create Bitcoin?

**Correct Answer:** To take financial control back from financial elites, giving ordinary people a chance to take part in a decentralized financial system\
**Positive Remark:** That's exactly right. Take a wild guess what those financial elites think about bitcoin.

**Wrong Answer:** To create a digital form of money that could be easily debased by a central authority\
**Negative Remark:** No, silly. We already have that with fiat. Try again and think about Satoshi's message in the Genesis Block before you answer!

**Wrong Answer:** To make it easier for third parties to facilitate transactions\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, that's not quite right. While third parties can be useful for facilitating transactions, trust in these intermediaries was one of the issues that Satoshi Nakamoto aimed to address with the creation of Bitcoin. Maybe try again with a different answer.
