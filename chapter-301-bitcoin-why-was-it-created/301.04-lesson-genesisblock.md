**Text:** It is clear why Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin when we examine the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, called the Genesis block.&#x20;

This block was created by Satoshi when he launched Bitcoin in 2009 and includes a reference to banks receiving bailouts following the 2008/09 Global Financial Crisis.&#x20;

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks"

This crisis, in which trust in traditional financial systems was severely damaged, inspired Satoshi to create a digital form of money that does not require trusting third parties for transactions and cannot be debased by a central authority issuing more units.
