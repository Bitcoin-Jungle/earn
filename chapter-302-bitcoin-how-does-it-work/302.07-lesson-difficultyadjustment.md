**Text:** A crucial element of the Bitcoin protocol is the Difficulty Adjustment. This algorithm ensures that new blocks are found every 10 minutes on average.&#x20;

When more miners join the network, the average time required to find a new block goes down. In the opposite case, when miners leave the network, it takes longer to add a new block. The Difficulty Adjustment algorithm adjusts the difficulty of the mathematical puzzle to match changes in the combined computing power of all miners. This prevents the creation of more (or less) bitcoin units than the predetermined supply schedule.&#x20;

This is in stark contrast to physical mining of precious metals like gold where adding more gold miners leads to a higher supply of gold and therefore a decrease in its price. In Bitcoin however, the addition of new miners only adds more security to the network.
