# 302.07 Quiz - difficultyAdjustment

**Question:** What is the main purpose of the Difficulty Adjustment algorithm in the Bitcoin protocol?

**Correct Answer:** To ensure that new blocks are added to the blockchain on a regular basis, regardless of the number of miners participating in the network\
**Positive Remark:** Correct! More or less miners only has an effect on the security of Bitcoin network, not on the supply of Bitcoin. Did you know that the total number of bitcoins that will ever be created is limited to 21 million?

**Wrong Answer:** To make mining more difficult for new miners\
**Negative Remark:** Not quite. While the algorithm makes mining more difficult when more miners perform computations, it also makes the difficulty of the puzzle easier when miners leave the network.&#x20;

**Wrong Answer:** To emulate the process of physical gold mining\
**Negative Remark:** Nope. The adding or removing of gold miners has a direct effect on the supply of gold, whereas the supply of new bitcoin units is predetermined. Try again!
