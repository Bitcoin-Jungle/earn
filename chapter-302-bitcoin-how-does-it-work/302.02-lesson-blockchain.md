**Headline:** What is a blockchain exactly?\
**Illustration:**

**Text:** The Bitcoin blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of Bitcoin transactions called blocks.&#x20;

Blocks are anchored to each other through the use of cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, as well as a timestamp and transaction data. This creates a chain of blocks that are all linked together, with each block building on the one before it.

The cryptographic hash function ensures that once a block has been added to the chain, it cannot be altered or replaced without also changing all of the subsequent blocks in the chain.&#x20;

This creates a tamper-evident record of all transactions that have occurred on the blockchain, which can be used to verify the integrity of the data stored on the chain.
