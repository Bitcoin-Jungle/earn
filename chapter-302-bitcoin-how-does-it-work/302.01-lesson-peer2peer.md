**Text:** To solve the earlier mentioned issues of centralization and possible double spends, Satoshi invented a solution based on a decentralized network of nodes.&#x20;

Nodes are computers that are in constant contact with each other. This by itself is nothing new. The internet itself has a similar infrastructure of interconnected nodes.&#x20;

All bitcoin nodes, however, store a copy of the ledger of all transactions in the history of the Bitcoin network.&#x20;

This new, decentralized form of bookkeeping, called blockchain, was first successfully implemented in Bitcoin and is extremely resistant to tampering.
