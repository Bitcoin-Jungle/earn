# 302.05 Quiz - mining

**Question:** What is the main purpose of mining in the bitcoin network?

**Correct Answer:** To add transactions to the blockchain and secure the network\
**Positive Remark:** Correct! Miners perform work in the form of computations and compete with other miners for who can add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and earn the block reward.

**Wrong Answer:** To make a lot of money\
**Negative Remark:** That's not the main purpose of mining. **** While it's true that miners do receive a reward in bitcoin for their efforts, they also have to pay for the electricity they use to perform computations. Try again.

**Wrong Answer:** To amass giant amounts of computation power for AI to take over the world\
**Negative Remark:** Wow, that's an ambitious goal! While it's true that mining requires a significant amount of computational power, I'm pretty sure the main purpose is not to create an army of AI overlords. Better luck next time!
