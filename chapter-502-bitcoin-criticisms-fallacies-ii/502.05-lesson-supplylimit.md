**Text:** Bitcoin's decentralized nature allows for its supply to be independently validated by each node on the network, ensuring that it cannot be corrupted. This is achieved through a consensus process in which every transaction that has been confirmed on the bitcoin network is independently validated.

While anyone can fork the code and make changes to the rules, it is unlikely that this version of the code would be adopted by the wider network. The decentralized consensus process and the incorruptible supply of bitcoin are crucial to its appeal as a form of money.

The maximum supply of bitcoin is fixed at 21 million, and any attempt to increase this limit would require consensus from a significant portion of the bitcoin network, which is highly unlikely to happen.
