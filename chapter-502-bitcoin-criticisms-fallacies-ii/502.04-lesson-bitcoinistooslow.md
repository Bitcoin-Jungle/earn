**Text:** Paying with bitcoin is not the same as using a credit card to make a purchase. When you use a credit card, your payment goes through multiple parties before reaching the merchant's bank account after a few days of processing.&#x20;

In contrast, when you pay with bitcoin on the main blockchain, you are sending actual money directly to the recipient without any intermediaries. This means there is no risk of censorship and the transaction is considered final once it has been confirmed by six blocks on the blockchain.&#x20;

As Parker Lewis said, "The proper comparison would be between bitcoin and the Fed as currency issuer and as a clearing mechanism."&#x20;

Saifedean Ammous also pointed out that "Using bitcoin for consumer purchases is akin to driving a Concorde jet down the street to pick up groceries: a ridiculously expensive waste of an astonishing tool."&#x20;

It's important to note that the comparison made by Saifedean Ammous refers specifically to on-chain bitcoin payments, not payments made via the Lightning Network, which are very suitable for consumer payments.
