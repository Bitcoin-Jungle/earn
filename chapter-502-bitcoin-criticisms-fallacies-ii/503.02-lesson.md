**Text:** Bitcoin is a neutral tool for exchanging value, and it has no inherent beliefs, opinions, or values. Its meaning is determined by how it is used. It is not accurate to claim that bitcoin's properties have led to an overall increase in criminal activity. Crime does not stem from access to tools, but rather from individual circumstances. If bitcoin is useful, it can be used by anyone, including criminals. If it is not useful, it cannot be used by anyone, including criminals. As Parker Lewis stated, "There is nothing inherent about the tools used to facilitate crimes that makes them criminal in themselves. Despite criminal use, no one is calling for the ban of roads, the internet, mail, etc."
