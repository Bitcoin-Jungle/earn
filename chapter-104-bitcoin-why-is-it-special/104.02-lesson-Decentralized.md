**Text:** Fiat money is controlled by banks and governments — which is why people refer to it as a “centralized” currency.\


Bitcoin is not controlled by any person, government or company — which makes it “decentralized”\


Not having banks involved means that nobody can deny you access to bitcoin — because of race, gender, income, credit history, geographical location — or any other factor.\


Anybody — anywhere in the world — can access and use Bitcoin anytime you want. All you need is a computer or smartphone, and an internet connection!
