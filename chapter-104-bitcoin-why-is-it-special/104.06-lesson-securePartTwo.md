**Text:** To be direct: the bitcoin network itself has never been hacked. Never once.\


Then what exactly has been hacked?\


Certain digital wallets that did not have proper security in place.\


Just like a physical wallet holds fiat currency (in the form of paper bills), digital wallets hold some amount of bitcoin.\


In the physical world, criminals rob banks — and walk away with US Dollars. The fact that someone robbed a bank does not have any relationship as to whether the US Dollar is stable or reliable money.\


Similarly, some computer hackers have stolen bitcoin from insecure digital wallets — the online equivalent of a bank robbery.\


However, it is important to know that the bitcoin network has never been hacked or compromised !
