**Text:** The store of value is the second stage of money's evolution. When enough people want money because of its special qualities, it becomes a way to keep and save value over time.&#x20;

As more people recognize a good as a good way to store value, its value increases as more people want it for this purpose.&#x20;

Eventually, the value of a store of value will stop increasing as it becomes widely held and fewer new people want it as a store of value.
