**Text:** While users prevailed and preserved the decentralization of the Bitcoin network, a solution to scale Bitcoin proposed by researchers Tadge Dryja and Joseph Poon, called the Lightning Network, started to gain traction and was launched in 2017.&#x20;

The Lightning Network, often referred to as just Lightning or LN, is a scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. It facilitates smaller, near instant payments between users at very low cost and eliminates the need for every transaction to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain whilst ensuring that the value being transacted abides by the rules of the Bitcoin network.
