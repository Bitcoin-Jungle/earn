**Text:**  There is a popular misconception that money is a government creation and cannot exist without government. This is false. The history of money goes back thousands of years to times when governments did not exist, but money did. This proves that money is emergent and simply the most tradable good in a market. It is not a government creation and certainly does not require a government to make money work.
