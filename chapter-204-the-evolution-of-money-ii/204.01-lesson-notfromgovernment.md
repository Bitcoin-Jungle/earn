**Headline:** Money is not a government creation\
**Illustration:**

**Text:** There is a popular misconception that money is a government creation and cannot exist without government. This is false.&#x20;

The history of money goes back thousands of years to times when governments did not exist, but money did.&#x20;

This proves that money is emergent and simply the most tradable good in a market. It is not a government creation and certainly does not require a government to make money work.
