**Text:** All national currencies in circulation today are called “fiat” money. This includes US Dollars, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, and so forth.

The word “fiat” is latin for “by decree” -- which means “by official order”.

This means that all fiat currencies -- including the US Dollar -- are simply created by the order of the national government.
