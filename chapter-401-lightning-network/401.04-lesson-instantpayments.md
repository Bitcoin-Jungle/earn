**Text:** In the Bitcoin network, transactions are grouped together in blocks, and new blocks are added to the blockchain about every 10 minutes. When a payment is made using Bitcoin, it is considered secure after it has been confirmed by six blocks, or about an hour.

On the Lightning Network, payments do not have to wait for block confirmations to be considered secure. Instead, they are instant and completed all at once in a matter of few seconds.&#x20;

This makes it possible to use the Lightning Network for retail transactions, peer-to-peer payments, or any other situation where you need to make a payment immediately.
