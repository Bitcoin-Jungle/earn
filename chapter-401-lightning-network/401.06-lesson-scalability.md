**Text:** Scalability refers to the ability of a system, such as a network or platform, to handle a large amount of usage or traffic without experiencing issues or slowdowns.&#x20;

Scalability is important for Bitcoin because the network will need to be able to support a much higher volume of transactions in order to meet the demand of retail and automated payments.&#x20;

The Lightning Network allows users to conduct nearly unlimited transactions between each other outside of the Bitcoin blockchain, or off-chain.&#x20;

This means that transactions can be conducted without the need for each one to be recorded on the blockchain, which helps to reduce the load on the network and allows it to handle more transactions.
