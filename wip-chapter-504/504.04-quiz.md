**Question:** What is the main reason that transaction fees on the main layer of bitcoin remain relatively low compared to traditional financial systems?

**Correct Answer:** The efficiency and reliability of the bitcoin network as a settlement layer\
**Positive Remark:** Congratulations, you've hit the nail on the head! The efficiency and reliability of the bitcoin network certainly play a role in keeping transaction fees low. Did you know that the bitcoin network can process up to 7 transactions per second, making it faster than some traditional payment systems?

**Wrong Answer:** The use of secondary layers such as lightning, liquid, or federated side-chains for smaller transactions\
**Negative Remark:** Nice try, but it looks like you're missing a key piece of information. Try again!

**Wrong Answer:** The fact that bitcoin is still a relatively new technology and has not yet reached its full potential\
**Negative Remark:** Sorry, but being a newer technology does not necessarily equate to lower transaction fees. Better luck next time!
