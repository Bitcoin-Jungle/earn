# 501.04 Quiz - willbecomeObsolete

**Question:** Is it possible that bitcoin becomes obsolete one day?

**Correct Answer:** No, it is not possible for bitcoin to become obsolete because it represents absolute scarcity and has a dominant position in the market.\
**Positive Remark:** Correct! Bitcoin's absolute scarcity and dominant position in the market make it practically unbeatable. Did you know that the total value of all bitcoin in circulation is currently over $1 trillion? That's a lot of digital gold in the bank.

**Wrong Answer:** Yes, it is possible that bitcoin could become obsolete if a more secure or widely used digital monetary network is developed.\
**Negative Remark:** Well, you're not wrong about that, but let's be real here - who's going to invent a digital currency that's more scarce than absolute scarcity? That's like trying to invent a circle that's rounder than round. Good luck with that.

**Wrong Answer:** It is uncertain whether bitcoin will become obsolete because it has both advantages and disadvantages compared to other digital monetary networks.\
**Negative Remark:** Uh oh, looks like you're playing it safe but not quite hitting the mark. While it's true that no one can predict the future, it's pretty clear that bitcoin has a solid grip on the digital monetary network game. Try again.
